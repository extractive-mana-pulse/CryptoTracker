## 📚 Initial Source & Inspiration

This CryptoTracker app is based on one of the premium courses by PL Coding, founded by Philipp Lackner, and focuses on demonstrating proper project structuring and clean architecture principles in Android development.

While the original implementation serves as a strong educational foundation, I wanted to take it further. To better align the project with my own vision and to make it something I can truly be proud of, I’ve decided to extend it with additional features such as favorites, home screen widgets, and more in upcoming updates.

This repository reflects both the solid architectural concepts taught in the course and my own enhancements built on top of that foundation.
